rosecomb
========

Rosecomb is a proposed satellite surveillance system.  The eventual
goal is an automated system that records Lecault-quality images
automatically, but we'll start smaller.

Another possible application to address is validating/refining TLEs
for tracked objects.

Required capabilities:
* Imaging from a telescope
* Telescope GoTo control
* Telescope focusing
* Image processing
* Prediction of position of satellite
* Prediction of position of sun
* (Automatic location of ground station?)
* Recognition of background stars (for TLE extraction)


All of the astro-imaging-related items can be developed under
'orpington', which is more or less aimed at those things anyway.  One
of the goals in orpington is to do imaging of solar system objects (eg
Jupiter and its moons), which is similar in scope to imaging larger
satellites, though with a markedly slower slew rate.

We can also build some baseline capabilities for the TLE extraction
case by adding closed-loop GoTo using star recognition, which gets the
capability to recognize starfields on the ground.
