This is a very janky ADS-B HUD.  It uses an ADS-B feed (currently from
dump1090) and OpenCV to create an annotated video overlay of a portion
of the sky, highlighting the last reported positions of flights.

It doesn't currently use the flight speed/heading/vertical speed data
to interpolate positions yet, nor does it actually track the flight
information from the video (partly because I have yet to actually see
a plane in the video feed itself, due to limitations of the cameras
I've been using).

It does mostly work, though, and can create an HTTP listener that
provides an MJPEG stream of the highlighted video, which is pretty
neat.

The code quality is very much "Plan to throw one away," so I'm
releasing all the stuff in this directory as CC0.  If you use the
code, I'd almost prefer you not mention me, as a lot of it is
shamefully bad.  But it does work, so, there's that.

Using a Real Camera(TM) with this:

I'm able to use my 500D with this by doing the following:
mkfifo /tmp/camera
gphoto2 --capture-movie --stdout > /tmp/camera

and then setting the `designator` property of the camera to that path.

Anyway.  Have fun with this!
